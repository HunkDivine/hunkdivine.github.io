Samsung and Sony have announced their plans of setting up their manufacturing base in India, which is a major endorsement of the Make in India initiative
‘Make in India’ is an initiative launched by PM Modi to encourage manufacturing in India and to attract global investors and industrialists in engaging with our growth story
As per reports coming in, Samsung is in talks with UP Government to establish manufacturing unit to produce smartphones and tablets
They had to freeze salaries of their employees in South Korea, and as per industry watchers, their new manufacturing unit in India can be a good help in overcoming their lowering profits from Asia
While no decision has been made yet, the potential products for manufacturing in India could be both flat-panel televisions and smartphones,”
Most of their goods which are sold in India are manufactured & assembled at East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, which can be done in India to bring down costs, and to expand further
Make in India is certainly a promising and growth oriented vision, which has the potential to disrupt manufacturing trends globally</div></div></div><script>$( "#dialog4" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false,  width: $(window).width()/1.25, modal: true, title: "Samsung, Sony To Start Manufacturing in India.

“With regard to coal, there’s a need to find a balance between taxing pollution and the price of power,” Jaitley said
The higher tax will lead to an increase of as much as 0.06 rupees in coal costs for every kilowatt hour of electricity, Rao said.
“We have to take care of the environment, and at the same time use fossil fuel to make sure we have energy at a reasonable cost for our growth
Countries attending the 21st international conference on climate change in Paris at the end of this year will aim to reach an agreement on greenhouse-gas reduction
That will help more than double the share of renewables in the mix of fuel it consumes from the current 6 percent, Piyush Goyal, the minister for coal, power and renewable energy, said in November.

“People initially think I’m Christian and then gawk when I tell them my full name,” laughs Saarah Hameed Ahmed (25) the Bengaluru girl who is the only known Muslim among the 600-odd women pilots employed in the Indian aviation sector
People’s reaction to her choice of profession is a constant source of entertainment for Saarah
Saarah says she too has had to face the brunt of Islamophobia that gripped the world post 9/11
She says that she still faces taunts from people who believe a girl’s only job is to get married and produce children.
When Saarah showed no signs of relenting, he spoke to his friend Atif Fareed, who is a senior pilot in the US.
If he hadn’t convinced me, I might have made the blunder of killing Saarah’s dreams,” he says.
In 2007, when she was just 18, Saarah enrolled with a flying school in the US
Her proudest moment, she says, was when a group of Muslim girls surrounded Saarah at a wedding and started asking her for tips to become a pilot.
“I really want to get married and have children,” she says
“My father has shooed away people asking them to get their sons to quit his job and move cities,” Saarah says letting out another blast of laughter.
She also has a Women’s Day message for Muslim girls like herself: “Don’t fret over what the community thinks of you
A native of Baramulla, Kashmir, she has already obtained a basic flying licence.
But she has to qualify additional training before she can be a professional pilot.</div></div></div><script>$( "#dialog8" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false,  width: $(window).width()/1.25, modal: true, title: "An inspirational message from India’s only woman Muslim pilot"});$( "#opener8" ).click(function() {$( "#dialog8" ).dialog( "open" );});</script></div><div class="col-md-4 column"><h1>Class 8 dropout becomes engg college professor, lands in jail</h1><p>Photocopier from Guntur forged three degrees to get teaching job</p><p><a class="btn" id="opener9">View Keypoints</a><p><div id="dialog9" title="Dialog Title"><div class="row clearfix"><div class="col-md-8 column">Police said Ashok Kumar Choudhary, who officially changed his name to Ravi Kumar Reddy, had been working as a professor at Saveetha Engineering College in Thandalam near Kancheepuram since May 2012.<br><br>Reddy, then called Choudary, worked in a photocopier shop in Guntur after he failed in his Class 8.<br><br>With enough 'credentials' in his armour, he changed his name to Ravi Kumar Reddy - the name of a PhD holder from IISc - and got the job at Saveetha Engineering College in 2012.<br><br>Choudhary, now Reddy, told his interrogators that he would read up and download content to prepare for the lectures that he delivered.</div><div class="col-md-2"><img src="data/images/india/2yb0vh.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt=""></div></div></div><script>$( "#dialog9" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false,  width: $(window).width()/1.25, modal: true, title: "Class 8 dropout becomes engg college professor, lands in jail"});$( "#opener9" ).click(function() {$( "#dialog9" ).dialog( "open" );});</script></div></div><div class="row clearfix"><div class="col-md-4 column"><h1>India: Muslim files suit against law banning child marriage, “offends Islam”</h1><p>India: Muslim files suit against law banning child marriage, “offends Islam”
